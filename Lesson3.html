<div  class="right" id="link1">
  <h1>What is Confidentiality?</h1>
  <p>Definition: Only authorized individuals, processes, and systems can access certain information.</p>
 <p> Confidentiality can be enforced with methods such as the Principle Of Least Privilege. This means access to data/info should be restricted to only the resources necessary to complete a function. Another method to ensure confidentiality is encryption, which is the process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access. </p>
</div>

<div class="right" id="link2">
  <h1>What is Integrity?</h1>
     <p>Definition: The guarding of data from destruction/modification. This means that the data is authentic, accurate, trustworthy, and exactly what the user expects it to be.</p>
  <p> Integrity can be confirmed through methods such as cryptographic hashing, that is when data is processed through a hash function which produces a unique hash value. To prove the data hasn't been tampered with, the data must always produce that same unique hash if processed thorugh the same function.</p>
</div>

<div class="right" id="link3">
  <h1>What is Avaliablity?</h1>
  <p>Definition: Ensuring access to info and any services that host that info are accessible and reliable at all times.</p>
  <p>Ensuring that data is avaliable when it should be can be challenging, due to several factors like Denial Of Service Attacks, Hardware errors, and bugs in the systems</p>
